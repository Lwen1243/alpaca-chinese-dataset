Clinging to a jade-green leaf, the mantis seemed insignificant, until her beady, black eyes caught the sunlight.\n\nThe Praying Mantis was a colorful creature, cloaked in delicate emerald wings, and an armor made from carmine and umber hues, with flashes of cobalt and ivory. Her antennae had a telltale shape that marked her species as an expert hunter, and her stance alone conveyed her purpose in life: to protect the fragile and unsteady, even at the cost of her own well-being.\n\nOn the heated jungle floor, the mantis lay in wait for her future prey. She was patient and alert, yet, the anticipation and loneliness she often felt was only a temporary haven from the dreadfulness of the real world. She was content in this quietude, honing her instincts, while her fears lay dormant in the darkness.\n\nSlowly, the mantis spread her arms wide. Her barbed feet were firmly planted and her gaze, determined. Her head swayed back and forth with the rhythm of a metronome. Time seemed to pass with an unbearable speed; however, the Praying Mantis was oblivious, preparing herself in stoic silence. \n\nIn an instant, the mantis jumped forward to snatch her unsuspecting prey, a fly. At an almost unbelievable speed, the mantis had caught it before the fly could even flutter a wing. The mantis had won, and the beautiful wings slowly folded as she scurried away with her quarry securely tucked in her claws.\n\nThe Praying Mantis had gained her dues and silence reigned in the hot jungle. The mantis had taken flight and vanished, her mysterious presence still lingering in the moist air.",

It has two masts and a cabin window towards the stern. The hull is made of stained mahogany, with a clean, white bow and stern. The ship's interior is sparse and well-used, with a small berth, stove and galley kitchen, complete with an intricate ship wheel facing the helm.\n\nThe deck is wide and spacious, with plenty of room for a dozen passengers and their belongings. Small benches line the edges of the boat, and a small wheelhouse offers shelter from the harsh sun and for steering the boat. Up on the bow there is a long bowsprit, which can reach out far enough so that one can look upon the blue and endless seas with awe and wonder. \n\nThe boat has plenty of character, its once proud timber now aged and weathered after years of use. It still sails proud and proud of its former glory, a testament to the age of sailing that still prevails in today's modern ships and boats. From the quiet morning calm, to the afternoon's gusty winds, this vessel is a timeless beauty that still has plenty of stories to tell.",

        "en_output": "Mobile phones can be a great distraction in school, causing students to lose focus and become unproductive. Therefore, it is important that schools have a policy that makes mobile phones off-limits while in school. By banning the use of mobile phones, students and faculty will be able to focus more on their education, as well as maintain a safe and productive learning environment for everyone. \n\nFor starters, cell phones can be a major distraction during class time, as students may become more focused on engaging in text conversations and playing video games instead of listening to the teacher. Additionally, some students may be more inclined to cheat if they can access any forbidden sites or apps on their phone, which could lead to academic dishonesty. \n\nMoreover, mobile phones can also be used by students to take and share inappropriate photos or videos, which can be a major cause of disruption and can also lead to legal issues. Allowing students to bring their personal phones to school can also be a safety hazard, as students could use them to contact someone that is not allowed in the premises. \n\nFinally, banning cell phones in schools is important to protect the mental health of both students and faculty. Allowing phones in the classroom could cause students to compare themselves to their peers, and they could then become stressed or feel inadequate. Additionally, students could become overwhelmed with activity notifications and feel a sense of anxiety or helplessness. \n\nUltimately, mobile phones can be a great tool for learning, but in the school environment it is important to ensure that distractions and potential safety risks are minimized. Therefore, it is essential that schools institute a policy that bans the use of mobile phones in the classroom.",

Music education is essential in helping students to become more creative, find their identity, and learn more about the world around them. \n\nFirst of all, music education encourages creativity. This is especially relevant in today’s world where technology dominates most aspects of communication. Creative music activities and improvisation help to foster the necessary skills that a student needs to utilize today's technological capabilities in different ways. Ideas are expressed through composition, improvisation and performance of music, which forms a creative outlet for students to let go of things they are not able to express in more traditional forms.\n\nFurthermore, music education helps to strengthen identity and build confidence. Playing music allows for students to develop their own unique style of self-expression, which fosters an understanding of one's own identity. This helps them to recognize their uniqueness, which is essential in order to develop a strong sense of self-confidence. The sense of accomplishment from learning a new instrument or perfecting a piece of music can be highly rewarding for the student and can go a long way in building self-esteem and self-motivation. \n\nFinally, music education helps to educate students about other cultures and the world. By learning and performing pieces from other cultures, students learn about different nuances of sound and rhythm that they wouldn't otherwise hear. For example, learning a piece of music from India will open the student to new ideas of rhythm and scale that they never encountered before. They can gain insight into a culture they are not already familiar with and expand their world view. \n\nAll in all, music education is an essential part of a student's overall educational experience. It offers them the opportunity to learn, create and express themselves, while also providing a platform to build identity, confidence and cultural awareness. Music education is essential in today's world, as it gives students the opportunity to explore their talents and help them grow as confident individuals.",
        "output": "音乐是我们生活中最重要的方面之一。它是一种交流形式，一种情感的表达，一种知识的来源。音乐教育对于帮助学生变得更有创造力、找到自己的身份并更多地了解他们周围的世界至关重要。\n\n首先，音乐教育鼓励创造力。这在当今世界尤其重要，因为技术主导了通信的大多数方面。创造性的音乐活动和即兴创作有助于培养学生以不同方式利用当今技术能力所需的必要技能。想法通过作曲，即兴创作和音乐表演来表达，这为学生提供了一个创造性的出口，让他们放弃他们无法以更传统形式表达的东西。\n\n此外，音乐教育有助于加强身份认同和建立信心。演奏音乐可以让学生发展自己独特的自我表达风格，从而促进对自己身份的理解。这有助于他们认识到自己的独特性，这对于培养强烈的自信感至关重要。学习新乐器或完善一首音乐的成就感对学生来说是非常有益的，并且可以在建立自尊和自我激励方面大有帮助。\n\n最后，音乐教育有助于教育学生了解其他文化和世界。通过学习和表演来自其他文化的作品，学生可以了解他们原本不会听到的声音和节奏的不同细微差别。例如，学习一首来自印度的音乐将让学生接触到他们以前从未遇到过的节奏和规模的新想法。他们可以深入了解他们尚未熟悉的文化并扩展他们的世界观。\n\n总而言之，音乐教育是学生整体教育体验的重要组成部分。它为他们提供了学习、创造和表达自己的机会，同时也提供了一个建立身份、信心和文化意识的平台。音乐教育在当今世界至关重要，因为它让学生有机会探索自己的才能并帮助他们成长为自信的人。"

Even though their chosen path is one less traveled by, they feel no regret or sorrow in the decision they make.

He is left hopeless and alone, reflecting on his many decisions that have brought him to his solitary fate.

At the convergent boundary, tensions in the Earth's lithosphere cause rocks to break, split, and move away from each other, creating a rift in the Earth's surface. As the lithosphere continues to spread, magma from mantle below rises to form new crust. On land, this process can create new mountain ranges. At the oceanic divergent plate boundary, new seafloor is created, which causes the ocean's depth to increase.",

Neural Networks are more general-purpose computing systems modeled after the human brain, consisting of interconnected “neurons”. The neurons are connected with weighted edges, which when adjusted can produce output when presented with input data. Neural networks are better suited for more complex tasks like natural language processing, while SVMs are better suited for simpler tasks like classification.",
