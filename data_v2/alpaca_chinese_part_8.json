Despite the weather, Thomas decided to venture out of his home to retrieve an item he had hidden in an old abandoned church. He had gone there to hide the item in hopes of one day returning for it, when the time was right. As he approached the church, a bolt of lightning lit up the night sky and he saw something moving behind the window. Unnerved by what he had seen, he quickly continued on his mission, opened the door and stepped inside. He was now face-to-face with the person he had come to retrieve the item from - a mysterious figure shrouded in darkness.",
